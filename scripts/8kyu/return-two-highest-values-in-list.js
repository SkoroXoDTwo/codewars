/*
In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible.

The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

Examples:

[4, 10, 10, 9]  =>  [10, 9]
[1, 1, 1]  =>  [1]
[]  =>  []

function twoHighest(arr) {
  let set = new Set();
  
  
  
  arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return b - a;
  });
  
  arr.forEach((item) => {
    set.add(item);
  });
  
  return [set.get(0), set.get(1)]
}
